# Pool Alone

This is a Godot 3.5 singleplayer pool game. I created it mostly because I wanted to try out a game with networking. Then gotm.io, which I used for hosting and the backend multiplayer connection stuff, went down, so now its a singleplayer game. Most of the art, excluding fonts and audio, was done by me.
